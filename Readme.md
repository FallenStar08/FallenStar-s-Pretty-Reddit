It do be making the old reddit pretty

## Overview

![](resources/Overview.png)

This repository hosts a collection of CSS and JavaScript files designed to improve the visual appearance and functionality of old.reddit.com.

### Features

-   Cool floating panel for sorting, also includes a "Go To" subreddit feature
-   It even checks if the subreddit exists!
-   It's draggable for no other reason than that it's cool.

-   The Navbar has been enhanced and you can now scroll it horizontally (like, with the mousewheel not the shitty ugly-ass RES button)

-   The sidebar is hidden and pretty (pretty means transparent)

    You can configure the colors used in the gradient & some minor cosmetic changes through stylus options :

To get the fancy bar used to collapse comments on the left side of the comments you need to enable this option in the Reddit enhancement suite dashboard
