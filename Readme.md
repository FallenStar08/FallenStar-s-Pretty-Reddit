This repository hosts a collection of CSS and JavaScript files designed to improve the visual appearance and functionality of old.reddit.com.

### Features

-   Cool floating panel for sorting, also includes a "Go To" subreddit feature
-   It even checks if the subreddit exists!

-   The Navbar has been enhanced and you can now scroll it horizontally (like, with the mousewheel not the shitty ugly-ass RES button)
